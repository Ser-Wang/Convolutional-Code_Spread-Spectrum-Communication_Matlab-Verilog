# Convolutional_Code_&_Spread_Spectrum_Communication__Matlab_Verilog
Convolutional code & Spread Spectrum Communication, Matlab simulation and Verilog implementation

## Matlab Simulation
- Including ASK, BPSK mudulation & demodulation, AWGN channel and corresponding noise.
- Convenient visual information: BER average convergence monitoring, BER result matrix printing and final result plotting.

### version management
- v1.0 Project created, basic functions implemented.
- v2.0 Significant upgrade: Structural improvements, much more flexible, much more user-friendly.
- v2.1 Added manchester encoding, DSSS.
- v2.2 Added BPSK modulation & demodulation, more readable coding.


## Verilog hardware implementation

Coming soon...
