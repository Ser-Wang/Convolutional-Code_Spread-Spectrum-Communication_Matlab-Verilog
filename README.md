# Convolutional_Code_Matlab_Simulation
Convolutional code simulation in Matlab

- Including ASK mudulation & demodulation, AWGN channel and corresponding noise.
- Convenient visual information: BER average convergence monitoring, BER result matrix printing and final result plotting.

--v1.0 Project created, basic functionalization.
--v2.0 Significant upgrade: Much more flexible, much more user-friendly.

## To be added
- BPSK odulation
- Manchester encoding and its concatenation with conv. code
- DSSS
